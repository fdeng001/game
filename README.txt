To whom it may concerned,

Flyving is a really fun game to me. After playing a lot of game in mobile, I think the most interesting game shouldnt need very difficult game elements or game story.The most important is easy and fun.
That's why I want to build my game and try.

Introduction:

The name of "Flyving" means fly with diving. The game have two phases.
First one:
The play needs to diving into water at beginning. he has on oxygen can, so he need to get back to the ship before oxygen exhuast. He can kill some fish on the way of diving and the fish will become more and more dangerous as he diving deeper. On they why he get back to the ship, since he killed some fish before, that will attract some sharks and player need to avoid them.
Second one:
If player has some oxygen left when he get back to the ship, the oxygen can will transfer to a racket:) play can fly to the sky and kill some birds and catch stars. When the oxygen exhuast, the parachute open and help player land to ship.
There is also a final animate if player can fish them.

Files structure:

Mainly scripts and all relates files included in "Assets" folder.
I will talk about some of important folder to help you check them.
"Resources" mainly parameters setting place for all game status.
"Scenes" included all kinds of game scenes.
"Scripts" included the game's brain:) all functional scipts are here !!

The game is programmed in C# with unity. if you want to check the code, go to Assets/Scripts.

Hope this will help,

Best,
